# The site
Discord4J is undergoing major revisions as part of version 3.0. Part of this includes a brand
new website! Currently the site is missing some areas including: a dedicated wiki, CI,
and javadocs section. But I hope to add these in the near future, in the meantime they 
redirect to our current hosts. 

# Other stuff
In addition to the new site, we are currently planning the full rewrite of Discord4J. The dev
team is working hard to make sure this is well thought-out, powerful and intuitive. We expect
for Discord4J 3.0 to have some form of release within the next few months. Additionally,
development of Discord4J will be done under our new [Discord4J Github Organization](https://github.com/Discord4J), as such we plan to move the current repository to this 
organization once Discord4J 3.0 is near completion.
