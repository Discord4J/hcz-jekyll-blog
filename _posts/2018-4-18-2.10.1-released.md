# Changelog
This release doesn't contain any really notable internal changes. This release was instead pushed so that we could promote the fact we 
now deploy our artifacts to JCenter and Maven Central. This means that our Jitpack repository is now DEPRECATED for RELEASES, instead
it should only be used for getting snapshots of dev builds. Please take a look at the updated readme to learn how your `pom.xml` or
`build.gradle` should be formatted (note the lack of the Jitpack repository and the group id change). Additionally, it should be noted 
that bots depending on 2.x builds should prefer JCenter builds since it relies on some dependencies only available on that repository.
